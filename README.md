# Roster

A searchable team directory — a real, buildable Hanzo app you fork on
[hanzo.app](https://hanzo.app) and deploy live on Hanzo Cloud.

Browse teammates as avatar cards, filter by team, search across every field, and
open anyone for their role, contact, and bio. Add and edit people inline — each
one is an org-scoped row in Hanzo Base.

- **UI** — [`@hanzo/gui`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hanzo/gui) (the Hanzo
  design system) under Vite + React 19. A clean, friendly light surface built
  entirely from gui primitives — no second kit, no Tailwind.
- **Auth** — [`@hanzo/iam`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hanzo/iam), OAuth2
  **PKCE** against [hanzo.id](https://hanzo.id). No local passwords — IAM owns
  every credential interaction.
- **Data** — [`@hanzo/base`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hanzo/base), the
  IAM-native, org-scoped data plane. `people` is a real Base collection.

Three views: the **directory grid**, a **person profile**, and the **edit form**
(add · update · delete).

## Stack (pinned)

| Package | Version |
| --- | --- |
| `react` / `react-dom` | `^19.2.4` |
| `@hanzo/gui` + `@hanzogui/config` | `7.3.0` |
| `@hanzo/iam` | `^0.13.1` |
| `@hanzo/base` | `^0.2.1` |
| `vite` | `^6` (`@vitejs/plugin-react`) |
| `typescript` | `5.9.3` |

## Run it

```sh
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
npm run build      # tsc --noEmit && vite build  ->  dist/
npm run preview    # serve the production build (SPA fallback on)
```

Out of the box it runs against **live** Hanzo (hanzo.id + api.hanzo.ai) — no
config needed to see the sign-in flow. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` to point at
a different environment.

## Environment contract

Only `VITE_`-prefixed vars reach the browser (this is a static SPA — there is no
server). Defaults in parentheses.

| Var | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `VITE_HANZO_IAM_URL` (`https://hanzo.id`) | OIDC issuer. |
| `VITE_HANZO_CLIENT_ID` (`hanzo-app`) | IAM application (`<org>-<app>`). Its redirect-URI list must allow this deploy's `/auth/callback` — see **Ambient IAM**. |
| `VITE_HANZO_REDIRECT_URI` (`${origin}/auth/callback`) | PKCE redirect. |
| `VITE_HANZO_BASE_URL` (`https://api.hanzo.ai`) | Browser-reachable Hanzo Base data plane. Deploy injects the provisioned URL. |
| `VITE_HANZO_API_URL` / `VITE_HANZO_API_KEY` | Optional — only if the app calls the Hanzo LLM gateway. Unused here; never commit a real key. |

## How auth works — ambient IAM

`login()` starts an OAuth2 **PKCE S256** redirect to hanzo.id; hanzo.id returns
to `/auth/callback`, where `handleCallback()` exchanges the code for tokens
(stored in `localStorage`, refresh-aware via `offline_access`). Every deployed
app is a static site at `<slug>.hanzo.app`; there is **no server token** — the
SPA authenticates the user in the browser and carries the resulting IAM JWT to
Base. "Ambient" means the app just reads the signed-in user via that token.

The one deploy requirement: the IAM client (`VITE_HANZO_CLIENT_ID`) must list
this origin's `/auth/callback` as an allowed redirect URI. Register a
`https://*.hanzo.app/auth/callback` wildcard on the shared client so every forked
app works, or register a dedicated `hanzo-team-roster` client to scope it.

## How data works — Base from `schema.sql`

[`schema.sql`](./schema.sql) is the app's `databaseSchema` (SQL DDL). On publish,
Hanzo Cloud translates the `people` `CREATE TABLE` into a Hanzo Base collection
(`provisionBaseFromDDL`, additive + idempotent). Base manages
`id`/`created`/`updated`/`owner`/`org`, stamps `owner`+`org` from the verified
IAM principal, and scopes every row to the caller's org — a teammate in your org
sees the row; other orgs cannot. At runtime `src/views/directory.tsx`,
`profile.tsx`, and `edit.tsx` read/write that collection through
`@hanzo/base/react` (`useQuery`/`useMutation`) carrying the IAM token.

## Deploy — Hanzo Cloud

[`hanzo.yml`](./hanzo.yml) declares a static build (`npm run build` → `dist/`,
served at `<slug>.hanzo.app`) plus the Base schema to provision and the env to
inject. Do **not** build a container image locally — Hanzo Cloud owns builds and
deploys. CI here only proves the template compiles green.
